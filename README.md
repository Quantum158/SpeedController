# SpeedController
## Version 2.6.0
A python application to replace the functionality of the Speed Controller Box at the Calgary Climbing Centre (Which is broken currently)

This project is still in development, as such, there is no executable included in the repository, feel free to follow my progress though!

Once I am satisfied with the state of the project, I will do an official release. Hopefully that will be sooner than later
