## Version 2.7.0
![alt text](https://github.com/Quantum158/SpeedController/blob/master/modules/Resources/Icon2.ico "Speed Controller")

A python application to replace the functionality of the Speed Controller Box at the Calgary Climbing Centre

Release 2:
Resizable UI is the key improvement here
Parts of the ui were changed as well, maintaining functionality while still having fewer parts

This project is still in development, and is changed regularly. Because of this, new app releases will only be released after significant changes.
