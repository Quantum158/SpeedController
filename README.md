# Why no development?
This project has been temporarily postponed until some further testing has been completed and I am more experienced on using the UI framework (and I have more time)

# SpeedController
A python application to replace the functionality of the Speed Controller Box at the Calgary Climbing Centre (Which is broken currently)

This project is still in development, as such, there is no executable included in the repository, feel free to follow my progress though!

Once I am satisfied with the state of the project, I will do an official release. Hopefully that will be sooner than later
